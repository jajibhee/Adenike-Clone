            legal show on the air taking on topical issues and helping to solve
            numerous problems while giving free legal counsel alone or with the
            help of others.

          <h4>Limb-loss is not the end!</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Amputees United Initiative is an initiative dedicated to enhancing
            the quality of life for amputees. With the support of the public, we
            are helping amputees live well with limb loss, raising awareness
            about management of limb loss and providing a platform to help them
            live their full and thriving lives.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The initiative was birthed from a place of personal journey to
            provide a safe haven for amputees, fresh and old, where journeys
            will be shared and experience heard, to strengthen each other, as
            these special humans continue to clamour for an inclusive society
            geared towards preparing Lagos and Nigeria towards the United
            Nations path to achieving an inclusive society in line with SDG 17.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Amputees United Initiative also creates a platform for persons with
            special needs to discuss matters affecting them specifically;
            ranging from educational needs, medical needs and infrastructural
            needs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The ultimate goal of the initiative is to create a facility
            encompassing amenities to promote an adaptive lifestyle (learning to
            use prosthetic limbs), establish recreational centres that are
            suitable for people with special needs, a gym specifically for PWDs;
            equipped with cycling and swimming facilities.
